GeoMASON-EpsteinModel
=====================

This is an agent based model that simulates civil uprisings based on Joshua Epstein's mathematical model of civil uprisings.

The model uses MASON and GeoMASON.

The major difference between this model and epstein's model is that this model takes into account geo-spatial information. It uses GIS shape files that represent Iran and its roads. The agents move along the roads instead of jumping from space to space on a 2D grid.

The model produces quantifiable results into a results.xls file that can be examined after clicking the "stop" button.
